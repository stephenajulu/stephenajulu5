      ####  Ajulu's Thoughts

      Ajulu's Thoughts is my personal yet somewhat professional blog that i started back after finishing my highschool days to share my knowledge of I.T and journey. It's still running to date and i still write frequently. I am responsible for everything, from designing the website, to developing it, to planning articles, to writing them and even marketing them. I believe it should be one of my experience because it was truly an experience and i wouldn't have learned SEO(Search Engine Optimization) without it. Here my roles as describe are Content Creation and Strategy. You can find my blog here https://ajulusthoughts.stephenajulu.com

      #### OwlSec

      Formerly known as OwlSec Technologies or Geeky Technologies or Geeky Desygns among other names is a company i founded back while i was pursuing my certificate in Business and Information Technology with a few classmates, I was the one who came up with the idea and invited my classmates over and as such was named director. After a few flops and quarels, i decided to lead the company to the future i wanted and hence parted way with the others and went on to rebrand it into OwlSec Technologies, i then found more people who i added into my ranks but during the Covid-19, i met a hurdle, the people i brought in wanted to be paid, did nothing and the company was loosing clients since i was the only one fufiling my roles, so i decided to put Owlsec on pause and focus more on freelancing, which is what i am doing even now. OwlSec has not died. I still plan to resurect it and truly chase after the vision i have for it, which is for it to become a known and trusted brand worldwide and finally graft it into my dream company Ajulu Enterprises as a subsidiary known as Ajulu Technologies. May roles here were Directing, Web Development, Graphic Design and I.T Consultation
    time: 2016-2021

      #### SAOA Media 

      Another company i founded after i paused OwlSec, since i had a strong foundation in content creation, i thought starting a digital media company would be easy and efficient, so i started one, sadly things didn't go as planned. Open 5 publications, writing 5 articles a day was challenging since i was also a student, so i paused this for after i graduate where i can handle writng 10 articles a day and still work on projects as a freelancer and a director of owlsec.
