  ### I design, create, sell, represent, market and build things.

  Hi there! My name is Stephen, i'm a freelance front end web developer, graphic designer, content creator, writer and I.T consultant. I am also a student currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree of Science in Information Technology and a writer, writing tech, cybersecurity, investment, personal finance, health, lifestyl and other articles on my personal blog https://ajulusthoughts.stephenajulu.com. I work as a freelancer online and as such spend most of my days writing articles, designing & building things e.g. brands, websites, software, apps, graphic materials, courses, pdfs and more.

  I am a self taught “technologist”, hence 60% of my skills come from Online Courses.

  To top that off I am a tech enthusiast always interested in trends such as Progressive Web Apps, The Comeback of Static Sites(e.g. Hugo), Machine Learning/AI, Quantum Computing, Big Data, VR/AR/MR, Blockchain, 3D printing and Robotics.
